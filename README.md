"PAAD.gct" file was visualised with the help of phantasus (online tool)
Data consissted of large amount of information, which was filtered.
Initially, 65 rows were analysed. Later on, only mRNA_seq data was considered. 
Expression from 18465 genes from 183 samples was available. 
Data was clusttered into 6 clusters. 
I was unable to analyse the data further due to technical issues in my system.
Inspite of installing bioconductor, with the packages like CePa, cmapR, etc, and multiple attempts to rectify the issue, i could not manage to access the .gct file locally to analyse and come to a solid conclusion. 
Heatmap for all the genes was visualised by using phantasus tool. 

As per the theoretical understanding, it is not possible to differentiate between the nneuroendocrine tumors and the adenocarcinoma tumors.
If PCA was done sucessfully, it would have been possible to comment on the trend and the important factors that can be used to carry out the analysis.
